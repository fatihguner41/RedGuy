A 2D platformer game for both android and windows. Made with Unity.

Player can move with w,a,s,d or left,right,up,down arrows. Jump with "space".

The goal is to complete all the levels by reaching to the portals.

Player has three lifes which are shown in the top-right side of the screen. If you get hurt you lose one life. If you lose all your lifes then the level restarts.

After you complete a level there are 3 rules to get stars:

1-Complete the level before the goal time. Each level has different goal times.

2-Collect all of three coins. In each map there are 3 coins placed for you to collect. Sometimes it can be tricky to reach them.

3-Do not get hurt ever.
